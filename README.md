## Google Calendar Sync App

Welcome to the Calendars Sync app! This app lets you synchronize events across multiple calendars you own.

Try it out: https://calendars-sync.app.genez.io
 
You could use it to copy over personal events to your work calendar so that that when you have personal events that time gets blocked automatically in your work calendar. Each calendar you add can be a source, a destination, or both.
